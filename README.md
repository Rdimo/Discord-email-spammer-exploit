#### 🎈・Description
First it unverifies and removes their email by making an invalid request to the api, then it just request a verification email from discord every 12 seconds or so (because of rate limit) which after some time will fill up their inbox in no time, an no need to even have an email yourself since discord spams it for you! Great job discord!

#### 🎉・Usage
```py
py main.py <token>
```
